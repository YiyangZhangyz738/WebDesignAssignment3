        <p>In general, education in the metaverse relies on the use of avatars, digital representations of users, which students can use to interact with one another. Educators can also interact within these digital learning spaces using their own avatars, resulting in a classroom situation within a virtual learning environment.</p>

        <p>Gaining a deeper understanding of educational opportunities in the metaverse helps to fully explore all the benefits it offers. Some areas, such as online shopping or events like concerts are already impacted by the emergence of metaverse platforms, while other areas, such as these listed below, are yet to see an impact: </p>

                <h3><u>Improved Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) </u></h3>
                <p>The ability to provide DE&I benefits is a huge reason why so much money is being invested in metaverse education solutions. In general, the concept of virtual learning has long been touted as a solution for accessibility. But the metaverse takes it a step further, ensuring that all students can feel included within immersive lessons. These platforms can also assist with equity by providing a similar experience for all users, regardless of their personal circumstances. </p>

                <h3><u>Relatable to Modern Students (Digital Natives) </u></h3>
                <p>Many metaverse education solutions place a strong emphasis on the gamification of learning in order to make learning more enjoyable. This is understandable because many students love playing video games, using technology in creative ways, interacting with one another on social media, and taking part in other forms of modern digital entertainment. </p>

                <h3><u>Can be Combined with Mirror Worlds for Immersive Learning </u></h3>
                <p>The ability to immerse students within a learning environment is one of the core benefits of the metaverse as it offers an accessible way into a mirror world. A mirror world is just what it sounds like, a mirror of the real world. The concept of mirror worlds, which are one-to-one digital maps focused on recreating the real world as accurately as possible, is great for building platforms for interaction.  </p>
