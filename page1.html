    <h2>The metaverse is the next evolution in social connection and the successor to the mobile internet.</h2>
    <p>Like the internet, the metaverse will help you connect with people when you aren’t physically in the same place and get us even closer to that feeling of being together in person.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    The metaverse is a virtual reality (VR) space that enables users to interact with each other inside a computer-generated environment. In 2021, Facebook’s parent company rebranded to Meta, expanding its focus beyond social media to encompass building the metaverse. The Facebook metaverse refers to Facebook (or, Meta's) contribution to the metaverse.

                <strong>Horizon Worlds.</strong> With the rebranding of Facebook to Meta came the introduction of Horizon Worlds, “an ever-expanding social universe” with “over 10,000 worlds and experiences,” and the expansion of its Meta Quest VR gear offerings [2]. The application uses VR technology, controllable animation, and physics to replicate objects in the physical world. It offers multiplayer gaming, music, interactive puzzles, sports, films, and more.
